Here are the lab files which I made during my training by Anudip on Data Analysis course.
While working on these labs, I learnt the applications of various functions in excel. 
I learnt about IF function, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, Conditional Formatting, Sort and Filter.
These labs have helped me to implement what I learnt in excel class.
